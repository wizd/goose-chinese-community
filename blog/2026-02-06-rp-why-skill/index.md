## What is rp-why?

rp-why is your personal AI collaboration coach. It answers two critical questions:

1. **Are you using the most effective AI tools for your work?**
2. **Are you asking questions that demonstrate cognitive depth?**

Think of it as a fitness tracker for your AI practice—it shows you where you are, where you could be, and how to get there.

**Want the theory?** Check out [Measuring the Cognitive Complexity of Human-AI Collaboration](https://engineering.block.xyz/blog/-gas-town-x-webbs-dok).

**Want to use it?** Keep reading.

## The Problem

**Without rp-why**

* Teams use powerful AI agents for simple tasks, wasting resources.
* Lack of usage visibility creates blind spots.
* No feedback loop keeps people stuck and stagnant.
* Sophisticated tools get burned on trivial work, killing ROI.

**With rp-why**

* Teams match tools to task complexity, driving real efficiency.
* Usage data makes patterns visible and actionable.
* Smart nudges help people level up continuously.
* Progress is tracked over time, turning effort into measurable growth.

## The Two Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Gas Town Stage (Tool Sophistication)

Where are you on the AI adoption ladder?

| Stage | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Chatbot Curious | Basic web chatbots, occasional use |
| 3-4 | IDE Integrated | Copilot, chat in your editor |
| 5 | Agent Autonomous | CLI tools like goose running independently |
| 6-8 | Multi-Agent Master | Orchestrating multiple AI agents, agentic workflows |

### Dimension 2: DOK Level (Question Depth)

How complex are your prompts?

| Level | Name | Example Prompts |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| DOK 1 | Recall | "What is X?" "List Y" "Define Z" |
| DOK 2 | Apply | "How would I...?" "Compare A and B" |
| DOK 3 | Strategic | "Design a system for..." "Analyze trade-offs..." |
| DOK 4 | Extended | "Research over multiple sessions..." "Create a framework..." |

## Start Now

### Installation

Install the skill:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/block/agent-skills --skill rp-why
```

Make sure you have the built-in [Skills extension](/docs/mcp/skills-mcp/) enabled in goose.

### Step 1: Initialize Your Baseline

```
/rp-why init
```

This analyzes your conversation history and creates your personal baseline. Takes ~30 seconds.

### Step 2: Check Your Current Session

```
/rp-why current
```

See how this session compares to your typical patterns. Are you stretching or coasting?

### Step 3: Track Your Progress

```
/rp-why compare
```

Compare today against your baseline. And ask yourself:

> "What's the most strategic question I could ask right now?"

That's the rp-why mindset.


## FAQ

**Q: How long does baseline generation take?**
A: About 30 seconds. It analyzes your available conversation history.

**Q: Will this slow down my workflow?**
A: No! The commands take seconds. Think of it as a quick glance at your fitness tracker.

**Q: What if I'm in the "Underutilizing" quadrant?**
A: That's the most common position for goose users! It means you have powerful tools—now it's time to ask bigger questions.

**Q: How often should I check?**
A: Daily `/rp-why current`, weekly `/rp-why compare`. Takes under a minute total.

**Q: Can I share my progress with my team?**
A: Yes! The output is designed to be shareable. Screenshot or copy the quadrant visualization.
